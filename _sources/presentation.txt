 Presentations on IPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


We have given a number of talks and presentations about IPython:

------
 2012
------

* Fernando's talk *IPython: Python at your fingertips* is available in `PDF
  <http://fperez.org/talks/1203_ipython_pycon.pdf>`_ and PyVideos.org also
  posted the `full video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26wgEsg9Mcc>`_.

* From our `IPython in-depth PyCon 2012 tutorial`__, we have PDF slides both
  for the `introduction
  <http://archive.ipython.org/media/PyCon2012-IPythonTutorial-Intro.pdf>`_ and
  for the `notebook
  <http://archive.ipython.org/media/PyCon2012-IPythonTutorial-Notebook.pdf>`_.
  The full 3+ hour tutorial video is also `available on YouTube
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G5YTlheCbw>`_.  Note that *all* PyCon 2012
  videos are online at the incredible `PyVideo.org site`_.

  2011
--------

* `Slides <http://archive.ipython.org/media/sheff_python_presentation.pdf>`__
  from a talk about IPython for the Sheffield Python user group.
* `Slides <http://fperez.org/talks/1107_ipython_scipy.pdf>`__ and `video
  <http://www.archive.org/details/Wednesday-203-6-IpythonANewArchitectureForInteractiveAndParallel>`__
  of a presentation about the new features in IPython 0.11 at the Scipy 2011
  conference.
* A `tutorial <http://minrk.github.com/scipy-tutorial-2011>`__ on using IPython
  for parallel computing with our new ZeroMQ infrastructure.

----------
  2010 
----------

* `Slides <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_scipy10_india.pdf>`__
  from a talk that Fernando Perez presented at the `SciPy India 2010 conference
  <http://scipy.in/scipyin/2010>`__.
* Brian Granger has written a `whitepaper
  <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About/Presentations?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ipython_winhpc_whitepaper_v1.pdf>`__
  describing the new support that ipcluster has for Windows HPC Server 2008. If
  you use IPython's parallel computing architecture on Windows, this provides a
  very nice way of starting the controller and engines on a cluster. The
  whitepaper shows how to get started with IPython and Windows HPC Server 200
  as well two examples of using IPython to perform an interactive parallel
  computation.  This material is also in our documentation `here
  <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/parallel_winhpc.html>`__ and
  `here
  <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/parallel_demos.html>`__.
  Many thanks to Microsoft for funding Brian Granger to work on this.

  2009 
--------

* At `SciPy '09 <http://conference.scipy.org/>`__, we had a `lightning talk
  <https://cirl.berkeley.edu/fperez/talks/0908_scipy_state_ipython.pdf>`__ on the state of IPython.
* At the `IAM CSE09 conference <http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse09/>`__ we gave
  two presentations about IPython: a `general one
  <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/0903_siamcse09_ipython_interact_fperez.pdf>`__
  and another focused on `parallel and distributed computing
  <http://ipython.scipy.org/talks/0903_siamcse09_ipython_dist_bgranger.pdf>`__.
  If you are interested, the slides from all the presentations at this meeting
  `are available
  <https://cirl.berkeley.edu/fperez/py4science/2009_siam_cse/>`__.
